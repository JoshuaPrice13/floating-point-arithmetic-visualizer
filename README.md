This Java GUI application demonstrates IEEE 754 floating-point 
arithmetic by visualizing binary representations and computational 
steps for basic operations. It is for practice learning about numerical 
errors like precision loss through interactive examples with 
detailed explanations.

>java FPAV

You must compiler all 4 files before running the main function of FPAV that 
acts as the controller by called the init of the JFrame I have created.
